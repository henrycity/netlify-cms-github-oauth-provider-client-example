      <strong> Note:</strong>
      When you attempt to Log in with GitHub in the NetlfyCMS it wonâ€™t give
      you access. That's because your GitHub account must have push access to
      <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/netlify-cms-github-oauth-provider-client-example">this repo</a>, which you won't have.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best thing for you to do is fork the repo and configure it with your
      own info. But, if you just want a quick look, send me an email (me@tylergaw.com)
      and I'll give you push access. (as long as the number of requests for access don't get too high)
